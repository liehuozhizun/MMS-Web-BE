## Brief Introduction

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MMS is a rest-based website developed with Java and Spring Boot Framework. This is a back-end restful service.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is designed for our staffs to manage our members' information and other daily transactions of our organization.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, this software uses H2 as the local database but will be replaced by a cloud database, in the future, to better support our staffs. 
A Front-end website is under development.

<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you'd like to leave a feedback or any other comments that you'd like to share, please contact either the IT manager or our organization.
